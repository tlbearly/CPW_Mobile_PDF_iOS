It will notify you that it is starting up your browser app. Then it will load a page from the CPW website with resources to download georeferenced PDFs. Use one of the resources described below to download a map. Depending on your settings, the PDF map file will either download or be displayed. If it is displayed, click the menu button in the top-right and then click Download. Once it has downloaded, go back to this app and click the File Picker button, open the Downloads folder, and click on the map that was downloaded (hint to get back to this app: click the Recent Apps icon next to the home icon at the bottom of your phone, then select this app). From the CPW resource page, click on one of the following resources:")

Set your zoom level. Then press the down arrow icon. It will allow you to choose the map scale but, may change the map boundary. Setting a smaller map scale will show more detail. Increasing the map size will show a larger map area. Enter a PDF file name and press the Create PDF button. Wait for it to be created and then press Download PDF.")
